# MNIST Digit Classification with Neural Network

This project demonstrates handwritten digit classification using a Neural Network trained on the MNIST dataset. It provides a clear and beginner-friendly implementation of core deep learning concepts using Python and TensorFlow.

## Project Overview
The MNIST dataset consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The objective of this project is to build, train, and evaluate a neural network model that can accurately classify these digits.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Dataset
- MNIST Handwritten Digits Dataset  
- 60,000 training images  
- 10,000 testing images  
- Image size: 28 × 28 pixels  
- Dataset loaded directly using Keras

## Model Architecture
- Input layer (Flatten)  
- Fully connected Dense hidden layers  
- ReLU activation function  
- Output layer with Softmax activation  
- Optimizer: Adam  
- Loss Function: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy
